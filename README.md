# Simple-Portfolio
BY: RISHABH VARSHNEY

### Built with Grunt, Bower, BackboneJS, HandlebarsJS, Sass

# Getting Started
The website is set up via Yeoman using the webapp generator

To get started, install the Node Package Manager (**NPM**) by following the instructions here:
https://docs.npmjs.com/

Followed by installing **Grunt** for automating tasks:
http://gruntjs.com/

And then finally **Bower** for managing frameworks, libraries, utilities, etc:
http://bower.io/

To install the modules run the command: **npm install** via Terminal. Example:

#### Open Terminal
Type in your project directory location (ex: **cd ~/Location**) OR drag and drop the folder inside the terminal window.

After installing NPM, Grunt and Bower, go ahead and install the libraries from the project.

#### Install
**npm install** to install the NPM dependancies
**bower install** to install the components, libraries and utilities

### You can now run Grunt to preview the project
You should now be able to view the project in the browser. To do so simply type in the following:
**grunt serve** this allows us to watch the project for any changes and run tasks (tasks are set up and outlined in the gruntfile.js file)

#### To publish the project for distribution
To publish we’ll use the **grunt —force** command (2 dashes), what this does is ignores any warnings and proceeds building the project.

Let me know if you have any questions.
